Peptic ulcers are open sores on the inner lining of the stomach and the upper part of the small intestine. The most common symptom of a peptic ulcer is stomach pain.

Peptic ulcers include:

    Gastric ulcers, which appear on the inside of the stomach.
    Duodenal ulcers, which appear on the inside of the upper part of the small intestine, called the duodenum.

The most common causes of peptic ulcers are infection with the germ Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve).

Stress and spicy foods do not cause peptic ulcers. But they can make symptoms worse.
